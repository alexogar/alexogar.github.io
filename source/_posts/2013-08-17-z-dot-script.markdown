Here are some tips for fast folder navigation in terminal.

## z.sh

Now [z.sh](https://github.com/rupa/z) is most used command in my everyday terminal live, it must be installed if you want stop using long sequences of cd commands. It will create some kind of "top chart" of you folders and will let you jump into them using just several letters. For example

{% codeblock zsh %}
z git 
# will move me to /Users/alexogar/Projects/github
{% endcodeblock %}

## cd -

This command will return you to previos folder

## oh-my-zsh

Has best completion support among all shell`s I have ever seen
